A dive in the past with reenactment of a medieval village inside the Lucca walls
with live performances, cultural events, exhibitions and gastronomy. This is the
third edition of one of the fastest growing events of the last years in Lucca,
that is attracting people from all the tuscany but also the rest of peninsula.

This year the exhibition will take place in **Piazzale Verdi**, on the green field
area on the left after entering the walls, on the weekend of **2-3 June**. Here you
will always find the medieval village curated by 6 different reenactment
associations, where you can see the equipment of many types: armors, helmets,
swords, bows and even heavy crossbows, a tradition of italian city defense
before the gunpowder invention. You fill also find many craftspeople exhibiting
their mastery on making unique pieces with iron and leather.

During the two days, we have scheduled a bunch of live performances held by
people with their own very particular skills: fire manipulation, falconry, drums
parades, flags throwing, dancing and medieval combat. On Sunday there is a
crossbow competition between the crossbowers of the city of Lucca, where each
Contrada try to win a painting made by a local artist.
